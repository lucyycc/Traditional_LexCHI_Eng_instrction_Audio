<h2>Mandarin Word Test Instructions</h2>

<p>
Hi! This is a test for Mandarin words. There are <b>sixty words</b> in this test. Each word consists of <b>two characters</b>, and you will <b>hear</b> the Mandarin words. Some of the items are real Mandarin words, for example, <b>科學 (kē xué) ‘science’</b>, and some of them are <b>not</b> real Mandarin words.

When you hear a word, you need to decide whether it is a word or a nonword in Mandarin.
